## Description

The goal of this project was to build the API for a social network web application, where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It utilizes Express.js, MongoDB, and the Mongoose ODM, for the creation of a NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

- You will need to download a number of outside frameworks:
  - Initialize Node.js with the command "npm init -y"
  - Install dependencies using the command "nmp i"
  - Make sure you have access to MongoDB and MongoDB Compass, for interaction with the database and visual confirmation.

## Usage
